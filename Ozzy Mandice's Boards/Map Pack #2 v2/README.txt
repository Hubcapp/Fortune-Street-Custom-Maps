Thanks for trying out my new collection of Top 18 Maps! Here I'll quickly go over some info about the maps inside.
If you want to know how to install and play these maps, check out my youtube tutorial on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woPglfv93Gc&t=1s
It's best if you place them on the appropriate maps, since they are supposed to fit the theme...kind of? (EX: Stadium and Circuit have more roll on squares because it's a stadium and it's a circuit). But the maps labeled "STARSHIP MARIO" and "GOOD EGG GALAXY" MUST be placed on those maps and can't be placed on any others, at all.

TOP 18:
stadium: A simple, good introductory map. This map is highly competitve for districts and shops, but still is a nice introductory map.

starship: PLACE THIS ON STARSHIP MARIO; It must so that the map doesn't break. Promotions on this map give you a looooooot of money, but are harder to get as you need to travel pretty far. The Vacant Lot market is very competitive here, as there are only 2, and three-star tricking is not viable enough due to the large districts where the vacant lots are.

circuit: This map has a very interesting twist to it: You can constantly loop around the Roll On squares to pick up stock really, really quickly. Set the Net Worth high for this one.

yoshi: From the previous map pack, with a few small tweaks

delfino: From the previous map pack.

peach: A similar map from the previous one, but redesigned to make it more difficult. It IS Peach's Castle, overall. Fun fact, this is actually the alpha version of that map, and after playing with it, I WAYYY prefer it.

trodain: It looks funky at first, but each loop has different sized districts. The inner loop has 3 shop districts that are overall cheap, as owning this loop is very strong. The middle loop has 4-5 shop districts. Keep in mind that you never have to go down, so it's good if you need a district badly. The outer loop has 6-shop districts with vacant lots.

observatory: If you really hate large districts, here's a challenge: Almost every district has 5 shops in it. The cannon's a beast on this map, too.

ghostship: Only play this one if you hate your enemies: The base rents of ALL shops are tripled! Set the net worth low here because it's sometimes too hard to invest correctly.

slimenia: HUUUGE thanks to HamburgerExplosion for lending me his cat map! (It's not my map). District B's whisker shops aren't obtainable other than by balloon, so if you're going for a long game, picking them up might be worth it. District I is a funky one, too.

magmageddon: Getting promoted is a little difficult here, as the club suit is only found in the warp areas! So getting that extra cash can be difficult at times.

robbin: I hope you like checkpoints, because this map is where they shine! It's easy to stay and constantly invest in your shops with the short loop points.

alefgard: A redesign of the "cloverland" map from the map files, set the net worth REALLY high here; On this map, you start with 15,000 gold, but can't ever get promoted! The dice squares allow for easier stock buying

mario: My take on a Monopoly board map: who hasn't done one? District J is a strong district overall for the 3-star trick.

bowser: It's easy to get promoted here, as each chain link farther from the bank slowly becomes less and less optimal as you get farther from buying stock, but easier to buy shops in as people don't go there: How much are you willing to risk?

goodegg: PLACE THIS ON THE GOOD EGG GALAXY; It must so that the map doesn't break. This map is the hardest map in the collection: If you've got guts, try beating 3 S-rank AI's here. It's not easy!

colossus: In this map, all the base rents are doubled! But unlike ghostship, promotions and investing are still feasable. But be careful when going for promotion!

alltrades: The sheer number of options open makes many, many strategies viable. This map is also rather difficult.

HONORABLE MENTIONS:
1: Deemed too similar to other maps, but an honorable mention nonetheless. Each loop connects here, making promotions quick!

2: A good map, but one I felt was too similar and uninteresting to make the Top 18

3: A retrain and remake of the Peach's Castle board for Easy Rules but with an extra area to make the map a little bigger.

4: A fun little map where there are only vacant lots. Didn't make the cut altogether, though.

5: Promotions are quick with this map, since there are 4 loops, all with full sets of suits!
