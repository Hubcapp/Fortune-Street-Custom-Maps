So, this is my collection of 12 maps. All of these maps have their respective names, like "kandata" and "2-07-hidari". I HIGHLY recommend that you scrub them as the same map name as their assigned (i.e. scrub "kandata" on the kandata map). As of now, I have not, and probably will not, release the music I did incorporate the map with. Feel free to go ahead and get your own music for the maps though. Also, please leave me feedback on what maps you liked/didn't like. You can be as critical as you like, but overall, I hope you enjoy the maps!
